# PartA2 adapted from mmdetection3d to fit LiDAR custom data (16 and 64 channel)
I used open-mmlab/mmdetection3d to train the 3D object detection model, PartA2 on a custom LiDAR dataset. 
Since it is very challenging to adapt the existing code to fit your custom data, I will be sharing my code with you. 

Coming Soon.
